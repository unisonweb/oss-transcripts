# Cloud start

This project contains sample Unison Cloud applications and stubs for practicing writing Unison Cloud services.

## Library contents list

``` ucm
@unison/cloud-start/main> pull.without-history @unison/cloud-start/releases/8.0.0
@unison/cloud-start/main> find
```

## Code style conventions

At the top-level of this project are two namespaces, `exercises` and `examples`. Users of this library are typically working in one of the two top-level namespaces at a time, so it is uncommon to mix them when programming. Terms which include the `admin` namespace are unlikely to be called directly by users.

## Code examples

``` ucm
@unison/cloud-start/main> edit 1-547
```
